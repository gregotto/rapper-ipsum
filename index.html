Yo, I'm makin' short term goals, when the weather folds.</span><span class="two words"> Just put away the leathers and put ice on the gold. Chilly with enough bail money to free a big Willy. High stakes, I got more at stake than Philly. Let's stick up the world and split it 50/50. Photo shoot fresh, looking like wealth, 'bout to call the papparazzi on myself. Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me. I'm outchere ballin', I know you see my sneaks. Look I'm on my grind cousin, ain't got time for frontin, sensitive thugs ya'll all need hugs.</span><span class="three words"> I'm not a biter, I'm a writer for myself and others. I say a B.I.G. verse I'm only bigging up my brother. I paid a grip for them jeans, plus the slippers is clean. Hova flow, the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats. This ain't for iTunes, this ain't for sing-a-longs. This is black hoodie rap. Get your fatigues on, all black everything: Black cards, black cars, all black everything. So we living life like a video, where the sun is always out and you never get old and the champagne's always cold and the music's always good and the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood. I'm liable to go Michael, take your pick. Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6. Only god can judge me, so I'm gone. Either love me or leave me alone.</span></p>

You tellin' me people don't look at Kanye West like the glitch?</span><span class="two words"> I really do believe that the world can be saved through design, and everything needs to actually be 'architected.' Because I sit back and think 'Am I the only one that's not crazy? I'm a creative genius and there's no other way to word it. This one Corbusier lamp was, like, my greatest inspiration. Nobody can tell me where I can and can't go. Man, I'm the number one living and breathing rock star.</span><span class="three words"> I am Axl Rose; I am Jim Morrison; I am Jimi Hendrix. I'm Walt Disney. I'm like Howard Hughes. I'm like David Stern. I'm like Steve Jobs. If anything, that's a compliment to them. I'm like Michelangelo cause I'm the new version of that. You don't think that I would be one of the characters of today's modern Bible? I understand culture. I am the nucleus. It's only led me to awesome truth and awesomeness. Beauty, truth, awesomeness. That's all it is. You will believe in yourself. I'm just the espresso. I feel like a little bit, like, I'm the Braveheart of creativity. I just wanted to tell everyone I gave Sway his first TV. And he needs to remember that. I'm 10 years ahead of your mentality. But I'm a champion so I turned tragedy to triumph, make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire.</span></p>

Thug life: one wife, a mistress and a girlfriend. When I die, bury me inside the Gucci store. Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing. Might valet park a Brinks truck. Let's play big bank take little bank. You are looking at a shark in a fish tank. Crocodile, the gator type. I'm allergic to the hater type.</span><span class="three words"> Where's Paris Hilton? Where's Kat Stacks? I'm Rambo with this ammunition, my camo came from Tru Religion. My Boost Mobile chirping, it might be my amigo. Dreads hang on designer everything, Mr. Comme des Gar&ccedil;ons, Mr. Alexander Wang. And I'm known to kick it like the captain of a soccer team. And I ain't crazy but if that's my baby then we gonna have to name that little baby Mercedes. I be laughing to the bank all you do is giggle. If you know me, then you know I've been thinking Franklin, money, thousands, Tru Religion trousers. Catch up to my campaign, coupe the color of mayonnaise. Rain, pourin. All my cars is foreign. All my broads is foreign. Money tall like Jordan. Got a private home started from the public houses. This that sauce, this that dressing. Hair weave killer causing her arousal.

I can you teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone. Sweatpants, hair tied, chilling with no makeup on. I might be too strung out on compliments, overdosed on confidence. Tuck my napkin in my shirt cause I'm just mobbin' like that. She said they miss the old Drake. Girl don't tempt me.</span><span class="three words"> All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait. I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures. How you feel, how you feel, how you feel? 25 sittin' on $25 mil. And this girl right here, who knows what she knows? So I'm going through her phone if she go to the bathroom. Where ya at? I gave you the keys, told ya bring it right back. I wear every single chain even when I'm in the house. There used to never want to hear us, remember? Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai. I'm the light-skinned Keith Sweat. After hours of Il Mulino or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' women and vino. The contract like '91 Dan Marino. We got Santa Margherita by the liter. Last name, ever. First name, greatest. Me and 40 back to work but we still smell like a vacation. YOLO.</span></p>

Start up that Maserati and 'Vroom! Vroom' I'm racing. I got 25 lighters on my dresser. I can feel your energy from two planets away. I got my drink, I got my music. I would share them both today.

Really I'm a sober soul but I'm with the homies right now. I never was a gangbanger. I mean I was never a stranger to the folk neither. It go Halle Berry or hallelujah. Pick your poison tell me what you doing. Would you say my intelligence now is great relief? And it's safe to say our next generation maybe can sleep with dreams of being a lawyer and doctor, instead of a boy with a chopper. Pipe down on the curb when you heard that I got these words to the upper echelon, that's excellent. I am the bad, the good God, the last the hood got. The last that would try to pass a good job. If Shawn's a Beatle than I need a ten-second drum solo. See you at Woodstock.</span></p>

Do you wanna bump and slump with us? We the type of people that make the club get crunk. As the plot thickens it gives me the dickens, reminiscent of Charles. When I met my SpottieOttieDopalicious angel, I can remember the damn thing like yesterday.</span><span class="three words"> Sir Lucious gots gator belts and patty melts and Monte Carlos. This is my story, this is my song and to them rudypoos don't attempt to try this at home. Chonkyfire, spiced with rock n' roll. Indubitably, piper pied. And if I see you in the streets I'd dap you down like you was Greg. YKK on your zipper. Don't everybody like the smell of gasoline? Don't everybody like the taste of apple pie? Long as you know consequences are givin' for living. Like a million elephants and silverback orangutans, you can't stop a train. Real guys go for real down-to-Mars girls. I will be present on the first day of school and graduation. Cause I'm cooler than a polar bear's toenails. Now breaker, breaker 10-4 can I get some reply. Time to drop these 'bows like Dusty Rhodes.

The moon's reflections off the lake hit me. All I see is C-notes, silk shirts at the casino. The face is silky like a tablecloth. My shorty gallop in the morning on the beach like a Chilean horse. I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Grambling. I'm sitting at the outdoor desk with my pants off.</span><span class="three words"> I'm Eric Clapton in the black Benz. The peppered steak was salty but I ate it cause I love her. Catch me on the run with a Nevada nurse. Suede snake, crocodile silk. Let me take it out to Coney Island. Now write your name 100 times on the blackboard. In the Z3 bumping U2. Ginger ale laying in the Knicks cup. Oyster bowls chilling in the cloisters. Six ducks in a wood-burning oven. Two jags. Cincinnati Zubaz. Next year catch me posing at the Tonys. Folding paper wilding at the OTB. Randy Quaid with the turtleneck. Smack the taco out your mouth. State your business cause I'm busy tanning naked. 360 in a Sea-Doo in a tux. Predict the weather by the wind like an old Mayan. Order breasts of veal at Walt Frazier's. Cheerio ship-flip like Rey Mysterio. Eating chicken parmesan in the holding cell.</span></p>

I don't owe you like two vowels. Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me. Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation. Approving million-dollar deals from my iPhone. Flyer than Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice. I got summer hating on me cause I'm hotter than the sun. Got Spring hating on me cause I ain't ever sprung. I parallel park in that red-and-yellow thing, old school Atlanta Hawk. And my chain Toucan Sam, that tropical colors, you can't match that, gotta be abstract. Quick Draw McGraw, I went to art school.  I'm about to go Andre the Giant. Gotta handful of stacks, better grab an umbrella. I'm counting all day like a clock on the wall.
